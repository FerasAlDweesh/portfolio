		<h4> Life is about experiences, here are some of mine:</h4>

		<div class="block">
			<h4 class="header"> Career </h4>
			<p>I graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering in 2015.
			I later interened at CDR Maguire, a major costruction firm in Providence, RI. 
			I joined Kuwait Funds' training program for Engineers & Architects, which provided a chance for a 6 month internship at G.O.C, Madrid. In Spain, I had the chance to work on real-life civil engineering projects, from designing the septic systems for cities in Panama, to routing the B-40 ring road for Barcelona. In Kuwait, I am currently an Assistant Engineer at TechnipFMC, a project management & consulting firm managing contracts for KOC's Major Projects' division.  </p>		

			<h4 class="header"> Travel </h4>
			<p> Travel is how I experience living. We live in a vast world, with various cultures and incredible landscapes, and travel is how I experience these cultures and turn them into memories. From Capetown South Africa to Bali Indonesia, I can never stop exploring how 7.5 billion people co-exist in different parts of the world and adjust to their environments. I've never counted the countries I've been to, why not start now:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> United States</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="header"> Intrests </h4
			<p> I'm interested in anything that helps me improve. Economics is one of my favorite subjects, reading and writing to further develop my language and skills, fintech, and now programming.
